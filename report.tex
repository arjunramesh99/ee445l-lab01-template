\section{Hardware Design}
No hardware design for this lab

\section{Software Design} % Description of what you changed or made in terms of software

\subsection{[File name.c]} % Make a subsection for each file you made or edited (in this lab, probably just Lab1.c and ST7735.c). In future labs, this will be more of a high-level overview of the design of your system, usually in the form of a call graph or block diagram or something.

\section{Analysis and Discussion} % Just gotta answer these questions

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \emph{When should you use fixed-point over floating point? When should
		you use floating-point over fixed-point?}

		[Insert answer here]

	\item \emph{Give an example application (not mentioned in the book) for
		fixed-point. Describe the problem, and choose an appropriate
		fixed-point format. (no software implementation required).}

		[Insert answer here]

	\item \emph{Can we use floating point on the ARM Cortex M4? If so, what is
		the cost?}

		[Insert answer here]

	\item \emph{OPTIONAL: When should you use binary fixed-point over decimal fixed-point?
		When should you use decimal fixed-point over binary fixed-point?}
