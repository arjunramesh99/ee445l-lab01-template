## Hardware Design

No hardware design for this lab

## Software Design
(Make a subsection for each file you made or edited (in this lab, probably just Lab1.c and ST7735.c). In future labs, this will be more of a high-level overview of the design of your system, usually in the form of a call graph or block diagram or something.)

### [File name.c]

[Description of what you changed. use `graves (tilde without shift)` for variable names and stuff. or don't. It's up to you.]

## Analysis and Discussion

*When should you use fixed-point over floating point? When should you use floating-point over fixed-point?*

	[Insert answer here]

*Give an example application (not mentioned in the book) for fixed-point. Describe the problem, and choose an appropriate fixed-point format. (no software implementation required).*

	[Insert answer here]

*Can we use floating point on the ARM Cortex M4? If so, what is the cost?*

	[Insert answer here]

*OPTIONAL: When should you use binary fixed-point over decimal fixed-point? When should you use decimal fixed-point over binary fixed-point?*
